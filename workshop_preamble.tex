\section{Document Structure}
We have provided you with an electronic copy of the workshop's hands-on tutorial documents.
We have done this for two reasons: 1) you will have something to take away with you at the 
end of the workshop, and 2) you can save time (mis)typing commands on the command line by using
copy-and-paste.

\textcolor{red}{\bf While you could fly through the hands-on sessions doing
copy-and-paste you will learn more if you take the time, saved from not having to type all those
commands, to understand what each command is doing!}

The commands to enter at a terminal are shown in grey boxes that look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
   commands to enter appear in here
