\section{Document Structure}
We have provided you with an electronic copy of the workshop's hands-on tutorial documents.
We have done this for two reasons: 1) you will have something to take away with you at the 
end of the workshop, and 2) you can save time (mis)typing commands on the command line by using
copy-and-paste.

\begin{warning}
While you could fly through the hands-on sessions doing
copy-and-paste you will learn more if you take the time, saved from not having to type all those
commands, to understand what each command is doing!
\end{warning}

The commands to enter at a terminal look something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
tophat --solexa-quals -g 2 --library-type fr-unstranded -j annotation/Danio_rerio.Zv9.66.spliceSites -o tophat/ZV9_2cells genome/ZV9 data/2cells_1.fastq data/2cells_2.fastq
\end{lstlisting}
